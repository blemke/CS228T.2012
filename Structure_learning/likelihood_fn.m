%% Calculates the likelihood of the data from the *log-linear model*
%% represented by factors, scopes and sizes

%% emp_exp:	Empirical expectations of the factors
%% factors:	Cell array of factors in the model
%% scopes:	Scopes are stored as a cell array of vectors of variable 
%%				indices, with one-to-one correspondence to factors
%% sizes:	Vector containing dimensionality of each variable in the model
