# Programming assignment for [CS228T Spring 2012](https://sites.google.com/site/cs228tspring2012/)
## Probabilistic graphical models - Advanced methods

This repo contains the programming assignments from Spring 2012 offering of CS228T at Stanford. All the assignments were developed specifically for Spring 2012 version of the course, by Kevin Murphy, Daniel Selsam, and Sanjeev Satheesh, to assist people who want to try the programming assignments from this class on their own. The code in this repo does not contain the solution to the assignments. Only a shell of the assignment is provided, along with some test cases, so that when you fill in the required code, you can test it yourself for correctness. 


 **This [file](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B7W6AEFt2Pa6U0VVS2t3VXN5cEE) contains instructions for all of the programming assignments.**

Here are the list of topics covered in these assignments (the repo is organized according to the technique):

1.	**Online learning**	Bayesian inference, stochastic gradient descent for training an binary classifier. Online EM for GMM
1.	**Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**	Gibbs sampling and Collapsed Gibbs sampling for GMM	
1.	**Expectation Propagation (EP)**	EP for implementing TrueSkill(R)
1.	**Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**	Structural SVM, Latent structural SVM and parallel structural SVM using ADMM
1.	**Structure learning**	Markov network structure learning with block L1 regularization
1.	**Variational inference**	for LDA
1.	**Bayesian non-parametrics (BNP)**

## Dependencies
* Matlab or Octave. Matlab is preferred, and you additionally require the Statistics and Neural network toolboxes. 
* [PMTK3](http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/)

## License
You are free to use these assignments as you wish. If you do use them, please drop us an email.
The solutions are not open, they will be available with the TA of the current offering of the course.


## Bugs

If you encounter any bugs, please report it on github in the issues section.
